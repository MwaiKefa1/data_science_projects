# data_science_projects

This repository contains a collection of small data science projects Iâ€™ve worked on to practice and showcase my skills in:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- SQL Queries
- Machine Learning (ML)

Each folder contains a self-contained project with code, dataset (if small), and explanations.

##  Projects
1. **Titanic EDA**  
   Exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset â€“ survival rates, age distributions, and visual trends.  

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Cleaning and transforming a messy dataset into a usable format (handling missing values, duplicates, type conversions).  

3. **SQL Queries**  
   Sample SQL queries (joins, aggregates, filters) on a small database.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   Visual analysis of a dataset (charts, heatmaps, and insights).  

5. **Iris ML Model**  
   Machine learning classification using the Iris dataset (Decision Tree / Logistic Regression).
